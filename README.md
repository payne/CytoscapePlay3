# Playing with js.cytoscape.org & Yjs.dev

This is a spin off of https://github.com/payne/CytoscapePlay2

## Plan

Then play around... plan is to:
1. DONE: Add a button to add a node
1. DONE: Mix in https://docs.yjs.dev/
1. Instead of randdom colors, each user has their own color
1. Maybe: Come with a way to add edges?
